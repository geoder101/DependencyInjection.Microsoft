# DependencyInjection.Microsoft

> DI extension helpers for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection that simplify service registration, lifetime preservation, and composition.

## Overview

This library extends `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` with powerful composition capabilities, enabling you to enhance registered services with additional functionality while preserving their original lifetimes. Build flexible, maintainable applications by layering cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, validation, and more onto your services.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package geoder101.Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Decorator

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var services = new ServiceCollection();

// Register your service
services.AddTransient<INotificationService, EmailNotificationService>();

// Decorate it with logging
services.Decorate<INotificationService, LoggingNotificationDecorator>();

var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
var notificationService = provider.GetRequiredService<INotificationService>();
// Returns LoggingNotificationDecorator wrapping EmailNotificationService
```

### Decorator with Factory

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IOrderProcessor, OrderProcessor>();

// Use factory to access IServiceProvider
services.Decorate<IOrderProcessor>((provider, inner) =>
{
    var logger = provider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<OrderProcessorDecorator>>();
    return new OrderProcessorDecorator(inner, logger);
});
```

### Chaining Multiple Decorators

```csharp
services.AddTransient<ICalculator, Calculator>();

// Add multiple decorators - they wrap in order
services.Decorate<ICalculator, CachingCalculatorDecorator>();
services.Decorate<ICalculator, LoggingCalculatorDecorator>();
services.Decorate<ICalculator, ValidationCalculatorDecorator>();

// Result: ValidationCalculatorDecorator -> LoggingCalculatorDecorator -> CachingCalculatorDecorator -> Calculator
```

## Use Cases

The decorator pattern is ideal for adding cross-cutting concerns to your services:

- **Logging** - Track method calls, parameters, and results
- **Caching** - Add response caching to expensive operations
- **Validation** - Validate inputs before calling the actual service
- **Retry Logic** - Add resilience with automatic retries
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track execution time and metrics
- **Authorization** - Add security checks before method execution
